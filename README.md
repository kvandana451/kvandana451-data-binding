The Angular CLI installed on my system is version 19, but the project was developed using Angular version 16.<br>
It focuses mainly on Data Binding <br>
1 way data binding(Component class to View):interpolation,property binding,class binding,style binding<br>
(View to Component):(click) event,change,ngModel<br>
2 way data binding(Component class to View and vice versa):ngModel,ngModelChange,change event.<br>
